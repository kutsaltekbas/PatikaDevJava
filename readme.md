# This repo contains the java exercises I did in the Patikadev Java Backend tutorial
- The reason why I do not use loops or shortcuts in some of the applications I have made is that those parts have not yet been shown in the course.
- The explanations and questions of the examples in the assignments section are written in the readme file.
- This repo only contains examples of beginner tutorial. Applications of advanced training will be added later as additional repo
